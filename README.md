<h1>About</h1>
This is a simple python script that was developed for a homelab server, that is port forwared through an ISP that doesn't offer a static IP address. Since the homelab server doesn't run 24/7, it just runs once when it is started. It creates a file, and saves the IP there. If it detects that the IP has been changed, it uses Twillo to send an sms, notifying you that the IP has changed.
